# User Guide

This document explains how to use the Maze Explorer application
from the perspective of an end user.

---

## Application Overview

Maze Explorer allows users to:
- explore mazes using different algorithms,
- visualize exploration step by step,
- compare algorithm performance,
- design custom mazes,
- export results for analysis.

---

## Selecting an Algorithm

Available algorithms:
- Wall Follower
- Depth-First Search (DFS)
- Trémaux Algorithm
- Maze Routing (heuristic-based)

Select the desired algorithm using the radio buttons.

---

## Maze Editor

- Left mouse button: place a wall
- Right mouse button: remove a wall
- Shift + Click: set start position
- Ctrl + Click: set goal position

---

## Running a Simulation

Click **Run** to start maze exploration.
The exploration will be animated cell by cell.

---

## Test Mode

The **Tests** tab allows:
- automatic execution of all algorithms,
- comparison of step count and execution time,
- export of results to TXT and Excel,
- visualization of distance-to-goal plots.

---

## Exporting Results

- TXT: saves maze layout and numeric results
- Excel: saves performance metrics
- Plot data: exports Manhattan distance over time
